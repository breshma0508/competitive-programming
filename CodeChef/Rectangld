Rectangled
Chef loves rectangles and he wants to draw one with the largest area possible, but the problem is that his pen has only enough ink left to draw a total of 
N
N unit length of line.

Help him find the largest area of a rectangle which he can draw if he wants to draw rectangles with integral sides only.

Note that he does NOT need to finish all the ink.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer 
N
N on a new line, denoting the ink left.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the area of the largest rectangle Chef can draw.

Explanation:
Test case 1: The maximum area Chef can get by drawing a rectangle is 
4
4, by drawing a rectangle whose length and breadth are both 
2
2 units, using up all his ink left.

Test case 2: There is not enough ink to draw any rectangle.

Test case 3: The maximum area Chef can get by drawing a rectangle is 
12
12, by drawing a rectangle whose length is 
4
4 and breadth is 
3

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=s.nextInt();
		while(t-->0){
		    int n=s.nextInt();
		    int x=n/2;
		    int d=x/2;
		    System.out.println(d*(x-d));
		}
