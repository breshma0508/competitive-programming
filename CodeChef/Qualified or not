Qualified or Not
TanMinati and Bhavy participated in the first round of a coding competition organized by the Coding Club, IIT Ropar during Advitiya.

To qualify for the next round, a participant must defeat both TanMinati and Bhavy.

A participant can defeat another participant by solving at least twice the number of problems as that participant.

Given that TanMinati solved 
X
X problems and Bhavy solved 
Y
Y problems, determine whether a participant who solved 
N
N problems can participate in the next round.

Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain three integers 
N
N, 
X
X, and 
Y
Y, denoting the number of problems solved by the participant, TanMinati, and Bhavy respectively.
Output Format
Output YES if the participant qualifies. Otherwise, output NO.

You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

Constraints
1
≤
N
,
X
,
Y
≤
10
1≤N,X,Y≤10
Sample 1:
Input
Output
4 2 2
YES
Explanation:
We have 
N
=
4
,
X
=
2
,
Y
=
2
N=4,X=2,Y=2.

N
≥
2
X
N≥2X means the participant defeats TanMinati.
N
≥
2
Y
N≥2Y means the participant defeats Bhavy as well.
So, the participant qualifies to the next round.

Sample 2:
Input
Output
5 3 1
NO
Explanation:
We have 
N
=
5
,
X
=
3
,
Y
=
2
N=5,X=3,Y=2.

N
<
2
X
N<2X so TanMinati is undefeated.
N
≥
2
Y
N≥2Y means the participant defeats Bhavy.
Since TanMinati was not defeated, the participant does not qualify to the next round

Solution ::


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
    int n,x,y;
    cin>>n>>x>>y;
    if(n>=2*x && n>=2*y){
        cout<<"Yes\n";
    }
    else{
        cout<<"No\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
