The Man Code
In Chefland, it is illegal for two people to use adjacent urinals at the same time (as it should be).
It is also obviously illegal for them to use the same urinal at the same time (as it definitely should be).

There are 
N
N urinals in a row in Chefland.
Find both the maximum and the minimum number of people that can use these 
N
N urinals simultaneously, such that there is no place for another person to join.

Input Format
The first input line will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer 
N
N, denoting the number of urinals.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line two space-separated integers: the maximum and the minimum number of people that can simultaneously use 
N
N urinals, such that there is no place for another person to join.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: With three urinals:

One person can use the first and one person can use the third (in which case the second is unusable); or
One person can use the second urinal (in which case the first and third are unusable).
The first case is the maximum (
2
2 people), and the second is the minimum (
1
1 person).

Test case 
2
2: With five urinals,

The maximum is attained with one person each at the first, third, and fifth urinals.
The minimum is attained with one person at the second and one at the fourth urinal.
Note that if only one person is using a urinal, there will always be place for a second person.
So, the maximum is 
3
3 and the minimum is 
2
2.
