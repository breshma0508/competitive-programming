The Coding Streak
TanMinati loves solving problems.
You are given an array 
A
A of size 
N
N, where 
A
i
A 
i
​
  represents the number of problems TanMinati solved on the 
i
i-th day.

A "streak" is defined as a sequence of consecutive days where TanMinati solves at least 
1
1 problem every day.

Find the length of the longest streak present among these 
N
N days.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer 
N
N — the size of the array.
The next line contains 
N
N space-separated integers

i
​
  denotes the number of problems solved by TanMinati on 
i
i-th day.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the length of the longest streak by TanMinati.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: TanMinati codes for only 
1
1 day which is the longest streak.

Test case 
2
2: TanMinati coded on day 
1
1 and rested on day 
2
2 so the longest streak of TanMinati coding is 
1
1 day.

Test case 
3
3: TanMinati coded on both days 
2
2 and 
3
3, so the longest streak of TanMinati coding is 
2
2 days.
